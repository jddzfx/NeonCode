RCUninstall.exe is an executable file associated with the Registry Cleaner software developed by Sammsoft, specifically version 4. While the program is designed to help users clean and optimize their Windows registries, there are concerns regarding its safety, as some users have reported it exhibiting characteristics similar to those of malware or potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). This has led to mixed reviews, with some antivirus programs flagging it as a potential threat due to its behavior or the way it is bundled with other software. Users may encounter errors during its installation or execution, which can include crashes or conflicts with other applications. As always, it is advisable to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before downloading or using such utilities, especially from less reputable sources.
